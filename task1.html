        <p>RIDDLES start off easy, and some are perfect riddles for kids. Others, however, are hard and may require you to be a math whiz. Many are plays on letters and words, so keep going if you’re undeterred. We even threw in some funny riddles to keep you going. Now, if you make it toward the end, you can try the rest, but beware: The hard riddles for adults will put you to the test!</p>
